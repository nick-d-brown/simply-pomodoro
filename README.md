### 1-Description :page\_facing\_up:

This app is as simple as its name, a non-stop focus/relax pomodoro timer. The pomodoro technique is productivity methodology where a user focuses for 25 minutes, then resting for 5 minutes. This is done three times and is then followed by a 15 minute "long" break. I enjoy using this technique for focusing at work, but I noticed two main issues with the system. First, our team was never in sync. No one knew when I was working/focusing and likewise I never knew when was an ok time to have small talk with my co-workers. Second, sometimes I wasn't ready to stop working and take a 15 minute break. Enter the idea.

The pomodoro timer created by this app is unlike others in that it is constantly running. This solves the first problem because the timer serves as a constant and universal time source with which teams can align their schedules. Much as a pianist uses a metronome to get on beat when playing a song, teams can finally achieve a synced workflow.

How is the second problem solved? The timer has alternating 25 minute focus and 5 minute relax cylces. Unlike a regular pomodoro there is no 15 minute breaks. Because of the timer is constantly running, user's have the ability to take longer breaks whenever they need them. This way you can stay in the flow longer, or break away sooner if you need to get away from a problem for a bit.

If you are interested in running the application, pull down the repository and run "npm start" in your command line. If you wish to contribute, feel free to create a pull request! and finally look forward to the announcement of the live website for you to use at work!

### 3-Challenges :scream::boom:

> **Note:** This section is meant for beginners an idea of what the *crux* technology was for this project. Ideally by seeing this first they will be able tackle the hard problem first to start the learning/absorption process as soon as possible.

This project has acted as a great refresher. I have used react in the past, but after about a year writing solely AngularJS, C#, and SQL it was time to brush of the cobwebs. The biggest challenge for this project was switching from an "AngularJS mindset" to a "React mindset". With AngularJS wide range of built in "helpers" like ng-class and ng-hide, it was a little tricky having to manually account for such things again. In addition to this, state management is also a slightly different game between the two technologies. Regardless, after reacquainting myself, writing code in React began to feel natural again. It just comes to show how important it is not to let "old" skills fall by the wayside.
